# Update on embedded display
## Current Progress
 - Display for Speed and Battery has been coded.
 - The variable for speed and battery has been created.

## Things to work on next
 - Need to connect the variables to vesc in order to get the actuall speed and battery value
 - The image of the battery does not change based on the battery variable. Need to code it so the dimensions of the inner box in the battery changes size based on the battery variable.

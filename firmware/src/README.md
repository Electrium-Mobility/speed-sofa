# Update on the embedded display
## Current Progress
 - Display for Speed and Battery has been coded.
 - The variable for speed and battery has been created.
 - The base value for the speed variable is set to 50 m/s and the battery variable is set to 80 %

## Things to work on next
 - Need to connect the speed/battery data from the vesc to get the actual speed and battery value
 - The image of the battery does not change based on the battery variable. We need to code it so the dimensions of the inner box in the battery change size based on the battery variable.
